        agentResponse: "Great question! A baking soda volcano is a classic and safe demonstration. You'll need baking soda, vinegar, dish soap, and food coloring. Remember to wear safety goggles and do this outside or in a well-ventilated area. The reaction is NaHCO‚ÇÉ + CH‚ÇÉCOOH ‚Üí CH‚ÇÉCOONa + H‚ÇÇO + CO‚ÇÇ. This shows an acid-base reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas!"

        userMessage: "What's the difference between ionic and covalent bonds?",
        agentResponse: "Excellent question! Think of it like this: ionic bonds are like a marriage where one partner gives something to the other (electrons), while covalent bonds are like roommates sharing things equally. Ionic bonds form between metals and non-metals, while covalent bonds typically form between non-metals. Would you like me to explain with some specific examples?"

Also, does the car pull to one side when braking? These details will help me narrow down if it's your brake pads, rotors, or something else. Safety first - if it's grinding, stop driving immediately."

Make sure the car is level, engine's warm but not hot, and you have a way to safely get under the car. Jack stands, not just a jack! Budget about 30-45 minutes and expect to pay around $30-50 for supplies. Want me to walk you through the steps?"

Aim for 1-2 pounds per week - that's healthy and sustainable. I'd recommend 3-4 strength sessions and 2-3 cardio sessions weekly, plus tracking your calories. Fast isn't always better - consistency is key! What's your current activity level so I can suggest a good starting point?"

Starting with the bar close to your shins? If pain persists, take a break and consider seeing a healthcare provider. We can work on hip hinges, Romanian deadlifts, or other safer alternatives while you address the form issues. Your safety is priority #1!"

Heat olive oil gently, add sliced garlic until fragrant (don't brown!), add crushed tomatoes, and simmer 20-30 minutes. Season with salt and fresh basil at the end. The secret? Don't overpower the tomatoes - let them shine! Quality ingredients, simple technique, perfetto!"

A good knife will last decades with proper care. Learn to keep it sharp, wash by hand, and store it safely. Master this one knife first - you can do 90% of kitchen tasks with it. Once you're comfortable, then consider adding a paring knife and bread knife."

I generally recommend that crypto investments make up no more than 5-10% of your total investment portfolio, and only money you can afford to lose. Before considering crypto, make sure you have an emergency fund, are contributing to retirement accounts, and have your basic financial foundation solid. What's your current investment situation?"

If you're starting in your 20s, 10% might be sufficient due to compound growth. Starting later might require 15-20% or more. Take advantage of employer 401(k) matches first - that's free money! Then consider IRAs. The key is starting early and being consistent. What's your current age and retirement savings situation?"
